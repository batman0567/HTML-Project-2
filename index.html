	<h1>My Top 5 Favorite Bands</h1>

		<dt> 1. The Smiths</dt>
			<dd><img src="smithsp.GIF" alt="The Smiths" width="395" height="252"> -The Smiths are, or were, Mike Joyce, Johnny Marr, Steven Morrissey and Andy Rourke. In an intense 5 years Between 1983 and 1987 The Smiths released almost 20 singles and 7 albums, and are recognised by the critics as one of the most significant bands of the 1980's. It is difficult to believe that Morrissey has been a solo artist longer than 2 lifetimes of The Smiths, but his impact on the music industry declined significantly after 1987.
		<dt> 2. Fleet Foxes</dt>
			<dd><img src="fleexfoxes.GIF" alt="Fleet Foxes" width="395" height="252"> -Fleet Foxes is a Grammy-nominated American indie folk band that was formed in Seattle, Washington. It is signed to the Sub Pop and Bella Union record labels. The band came to prominence in 2008 with the release of its second EP, Sun Giant, and its first, self-titled album Fleet Foxes. Both received much critical praise and reviewers often noted the band's use of refined lyrics and vocal harmonies. Fleet Foxes' second studio album, Helplessness Blues, was released on 3 May 2011.
